# DL_Implementations
My Theano and TF implementations of various DL algorithms 

Includes:

1) CNN in theano
2) CNN (Same architecture) in TensorFlow to highlight the fundamental differences in Theano and TF. 

If you find that my hyperparameter tuning is incorrect, and that its possible to produce better results with the same amount of data, please open a pull request! All inputs are welcome.
